# Solutions to Advent of Code 2022 in Rust

I am doing this in Rust as a way to try to become familiar with the language
and some of the tools the standard library offers you.

Some of these solutions are probably accidentally insane and I'll look back in shame later. Some of the solutions
are _intentionally_ insane because I wanted to learn / mess around with some feature I didn't need.
